# To Do List

A simple to do list application, built to better understand CRUD operations.

## Stack

- React
- (ChakraUI)[https://chakra-ui.com/]

## What I Learned

- CRUD operations with state in React are simple to execute.
- Reinforced my familiarity with ChakraUI. 
- `<input type="date" />` is challenging to update, and doesn't automatically validate dates.

## To do

- Add date validation

## Possible future projects

- Allow users to sort tasks in the main list
- Use categories to group and sort tasks
- Make full-stack, using NextJS and Firebase
